# ODTos65
Create a tool for OSI computers similar to the ADTPro tool for Apple II computers

Intro:

ADTPro (Apple Disk Tool ProDOS), is an amazing tool for Apple II computers.  Using nothing but a serial
connection, ADTPRo can push across a small assembly program that allows a PC to push across ProDOS operating
system, boot the Apple II and move disk images to the Apple II.  The OSI world has some pieces of this 
functionality with the disk tools of David Gesswein and Mark Spankus.  What the OSI line lacks is the nice 
server program that allows a low-frustration setup of an OSI starting at basically 'ground zero'.

Goals:

Create an equivalent of the ADTPro for OSI computers, Starting with purely serial-based systems and moving to 
the later video-based ones.

Re-use of existing code (ADTPro, OSI DIsk tools) is key, wih permission of course.

To Do:

1.  Request permission from original authors
2.  Prototype and document serial connection and serial boot process (hack together a client and server)
3.  Iterate features - disk formatting, disk image transfer, etc.
4.  More feature work to full ADTPro functionality
5.  Beta testing
6.  Initial release
